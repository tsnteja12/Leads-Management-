Title: Basic Lead Management System

Problem statement: A business receives leads from different sources and wants a system to track, assign, and follow up on them efficiently. The current process is manual, leading to lost opportunities.

Industry Context:
Small and medium businesses (SMBs) often struggle to track and manage leads from various sources like calls, emails, and web forms. Without a proper system, leads get lost, and sales follow-ups are delayed

Target Users:
Sales Representatives: manage and update leads
Sales Managers: monitor performance and reports
Admins: configure and maintain Salesforce setup
